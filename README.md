# Identity Proofing User Guide

## SecZetta Identity Proofing

As enterprise organizations increasingly grant access to facilities, data, and systems to an ever-expanding number of third-party users, it becomes imperative for them to prove that these people are in fact who they claim to be.  

### IDProofing

With SecZetta’s IDProofing it’s possible to easily invoke large scale or individual identity verification during the onboarding process or at any time throughout the identity lifecycle. 

### Goal of the Document

This document is designed to familiarize users with IDProofing features and functionality.


## Understanding the Tool

IDProofing can be configured to leverage mobile carrier records or the combination of a government issued photo ID (see below) and a live selfie to confirm that users are who they claim to be.  When enabled, IDProofing shows as an action within the Third-Party Identity Risk workflow engine.  A user may be prompted to prove their identity during onboarding or at any point during their lifecycle.
